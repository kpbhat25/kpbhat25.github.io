I am a second year MS (by Research) student in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/) at the esteemed [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), where I am affiliated with the  Sudha Gopalakrishnan Brain Centre ([SGBC]([SGBC-IITM](https://public.humanbrain.in/public/))) Lab.Under the expert guidance of [Prof.Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam]((https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/mohan/)).I am pursuing my research in the field of Bio-Medical Image Processing, with a specific focus on Registration and Segmentation. My research aims to explore the applicability of these techniques on a large-scale dataset.

Prior to my postgraduate studies, I successfully completed my Bachelor's in Engineering from [B.M.S.College of Engineering](https://www.bmsce.ac.in/), which provided a strong foundation for my current academic pursuits.
