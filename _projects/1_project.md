**📝 ABSTRACT**

The purpose of 🚗 Black Box in an automobile, much like the one installed in air transportation, is to record and trace vital data. This device captures information about the vehicle's journey, including the driver's identity, speed, position, and more. With a GPS module and processor, it records position and time, securely storing it in the 🌩️ Cloud Storage System. Additionally, it features a Pi-Cam, leveraging 📷 OpenCV technology to detect driver drowsiness and issue timely warnings. Seat belt detection is also integrated into this smart system.

The data is linked to a Mobile Application and Website, allowing easy access to the information anytime. The components are well-protected with sturdy 💪 Stainless Steel, offering excellent melting point range and impact resistance. In case of accidents, the stored cloud data aids concerned authorities in reconstructing the vehicle's position and time, supporting innocent individuals to claim insurance benefits.

**💡 MOTIVATION**

The main causes of accidents in India are attributed to Drowsiness, 🏎️ Over Speeding, 🍻 Drink and Drive, Improper Lane Change, 🛣️ Road Engineering, Overtaking, and Signal Jumping. These driver-related causes contribute to 78% of total accidents. Leveraging innovative technology, we aim to combat some of these causes, and the Black Box is one such solution. While similar to the ones used in aircraft, our Black Box is designed to be less complicated and suitable for road vehicles.

**📊 Results**

We successfully developed a Black Box with advanced features that securely sends GPS data updates to the cloud. This data can be accessed and utilized by the authorities through our tailored platforms.

**🏁 Conclusion**

To create our solution, we collaborated with Traffic Authorities in Bengaluru, drawing insights and conducting case studies. Upon presenting our work to them, they acknowledged that this product would lead to reduced manpower for certain tasks, showcasing its potential impact on road safety. 🛣️🚦
